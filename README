Here are example input files for the results presented in the paper 'Resetting Metadynamics'.
They include representative LAMMPS, GROMACS and plumed input files for two model systems and a molecular system.
In addition, examples for the implementation of resetting in Python are given for both LAMMPS and GROMACS simulations.
