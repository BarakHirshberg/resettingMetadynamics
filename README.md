Here are example input files and raw data for the results presented in the paper 
'Combining stochastic resetting with Metadynamics to speed-up molecular dynamics simulations'.
They include representative LAMMPS, GROMACS, and plumed input files for two model systems and a molecular system.
In addition, examples for implementing resetting in Python are given for both LAMMPS and GROMACS simulations.
